    <div style="margin: 2rem; color: #00171f; font-weight: 300; font-size: larger;">
       <p> The Indus Waters Treaty is a water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan, brokered by the World Bank and signed on September 19, 1960. It is one of the most successful international water treaties and has withstood the test of time despite the often tense relationship between the two countries.</p>
       <p> Background: </p>
    <p>Partition of India in 1947: When British India was divided into India and Pakistan in 1947, the Indus River system was split between the two countries. The headwaters of the Indus and its tributaries were primarily in India, while the rivers flowed downstream into Pakistan, which raised concerns for Pakistan about its water security.</p>

<p>Initial Conflicts: Shortly after partition, tensions arose when India stopped the flow of water to Pakistan from canals originating in Indian territory. This created a crisis, as agriculture in Pakistan, particularly in Punjab, heavily depended on this water.</p>

<p>Temporary Agreements: To avoid an escalation, both countries signed a temporary standstill agreement in 1948, allowing water to continue flowing to Pakistan until a permanent solution could be found. However, disputes continued, and the need for a long-term resolution became increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process:</p>
<p>World Bank Involvement: In 1951, David Lilienthal, a former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, visited the region and suggested that the World Bank mediate the dispute. The World Bank's involvement was pivotal because it provided a neutral platform for both countries to negotiate.</p>

<p>Technical and Diplomatic Negotiations: Negotiations took nearly a decade and involved a series of technical discussions, proposals, and counter-proposals. Both countries had different prioritiesâ€”Pakistan wanted assurances for water supplies, while India sought to secure its right to use the waters of the rivers within its territory.</p>

<p>Division of Rivers: A major breakthrough came when both parties agreed to divide the rivers of the Indus Basin. India was allocated the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej), while Pakistan received the three western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab). This division was crucial in finalizing the treaty.</p>

<p>Signing of the Treaty:</p>
Final Agreement: The treaty was signed on September 19, 1960, in Karachi by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistani President Ayub Khan, with the World Bank's president serving as the signatory for the institution.

Provisions and Mechanisms: The treaty included detailed provisions on how the water would be shared, mechanisms for resolving disputes, and a commitment to cooperate on water management. The World Bank played a role as a guarantor, ensuring both sides adhered to the agreement.

<p>Post-Treaty Developments:</p>
<p>Indus Commission: The treaty established a Permanent Indus Commission to oversee its implementation and handle any disagreements. The commission continues to function and meet regularly, which has helped maintain the treaty despite political tensions between the two countries.</p>

<p>Long-Term Impact: The treaty has been remarkably successful, remaining in force despite multiple wars and ongoing hostility between India and Pakistan. It is often cited as an example of successful water diplomacy and conflict resolution.</p>
